Entrepreneur, blockchain specialist, software architect, coach and passionate about the latest technological developments, I am also a geek and musician!

NewTech oriented (Open Source, Blockchain, CrossPlatform, WebApp), I am able to solve many scenarios while respecting the application of good software development practices.

## 🌱 How I Work

A developer is first and foremost a creative person... and a creative person's ideas don't necessarily arrive during office hours. 😁 That's why I prefer working remotely, be it day or night, always fueled by caffeine. ☕
