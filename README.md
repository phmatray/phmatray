I'm Philippe Matray, a Technical Solutions Architect and Coach with a deep passion for innovative technologies and architectures. I guide teams in developing effective solutions and relish in the challenge of turning complex problems into simple, scalable solutions. When I'm not immersed in the tech world, you can find me playing my favorite musical pieces.

## 🎯 My Focus
I am particularly excited about emerging technologies such as Prompt Engineering, DevOps, open source, blockchain, cross-platform and progressive web applications. I utilize my skills in solution architecture and coaching to guide development teams to build high quality, effective solutions.

As a firm believer in the value of methodologies like SCRUM, DDD, TDD, and BDD, as well as Clean Code and Hexagonal architectures, I relish in teaching and instilling these principles into developers' practices to help them reach their full potential.

## 🌱 How I Work
A developer is first and foremost a creative person... and a creative person's ideas don't necessarily arrive during office hours. 😁 That's why I prefer working remotely, be it day or night, always fueled by caffeine. ☕

## 💡 My Motto
> "A day without learning is a day lost."

## 📝 MBTI Personality
I'm an INTP (Logician) - my approach to solutions is deeply analytical and I thrive on challenging the status quo.
