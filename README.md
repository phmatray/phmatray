Entrepreneur, blockchain specialist, software architect, coach and passionate about the latest technological developments, I am also a geek and musician!

NewTech oriented (Open Source, Blockchain, CrossPlatform, WebApp), I am able to solve many scenarios while respecting the application of good software development practices.

## How I work

A developer is first and foremost a creative person... and a creative person's ideas don't necessarily arrive during office hours. 😁

That's why I prefer working remotely by day or by night and with caffeine. ☕

## My motto

> To love music is to guarantee a quarter of your happiness. 🎵
